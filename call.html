      A presentation could be about a thesis, an in-class project or some other topic you researched on or care about.
      We invite presentations in the following forms:
      <section>
        <h2>Talks</h2>
            <ul>
            Talks should take about 30 minutes and can be held in English or German.
            </ul>
      </section>
      
    <section>
        <h2>Posters</h2>
        <ul>
            Don't like talking in front of many people? Then this might be the right format for you. You can present your work with a poster during breakfast and chat with interested people as they come by.
        </ul>
      </section>
      
     <section>
        <h2>Tutorials</h2>
        <ul>
            You've learned something cool (the hard way) and want to share your knowledge? Consider giving a tutorial :)
        </ul>
