Welcome to the very first post on our Travis Foundation!
Hopefully we'll end up having a bunch of great content for you here.

    puts "Hello, Open Source world!"

If you want to help us make Open Source even better: wonderful! You can submit a pull-request
on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-foundation).

If you want to subscribe via RSS feed, help us set up one and open an issue in Github. Every help is hugely appreciated!

We bet, you are as excited as we are, let's get this blog started and share some news!
