Unfortunately, you have to pay a fee of TODO â‚¬ to help cover the costs of the conference. Included in the costs are at least:
- breakfast on saturday and sunday
- lunch and dinner on saturday
- beverages and snacks during the conference

You can avoid paying the fee by [presenting](/tacos29/call/) something :) 

As soon as the registration is open, we will link it here.
