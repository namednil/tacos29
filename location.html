        <h2>Saarbrücken</h2>
          <ul>
              Saarbrücken is the cultural and political capital of the Saarland and located at the French border. 
              
              <p>Regarding accomodation, we will organize a coli couch surfing. Apart from that, there is also a <a href="https://www.jugendherberge.de/jugendherbergen/saarbruecken-420/portraet/">youth hostel</a>, which unfortunately is fully booked on Saturday. If your budget is small and you couldn't find a couch, you could book the youth hostel on Friday and Sunday and move in between.
