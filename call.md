    <h2>Presenting at TaCoS 29</h2>
    <p>
      A presentation could be about a thesis, an in-class project or some other topic you researched on or anything you care about related to computational linguistics.
      We invite presentations in the following forms:
    </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Long Talks</h3>
        <ul>
          Long Talks should take 30 minutes and can be held in English or German. Speakers don't have to pay the attendence fee.
        </ul>
      </section>
      
    <section>
        <h3>Short Talks</h3>
        <ul>

      <section>
        <h3>Posters</h3>
        <ul>
          Don't like talking in front of many people? Then this might be the right format for you. You can present your
          work with a poster during breakfast and chat with interested people as they come by. By the way, presenters of posters pay half of the attendence fee.

        <h3>Tutorials</h3>
        <ul>
          You've learned something cool (the hard way) and want to share your knowledge? Consider giving a tutorial! By the way, presenters of tutorials don't have to pay the attendence fee.
        </ul>
